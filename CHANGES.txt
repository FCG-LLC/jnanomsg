WARNING: This is a major api rework with a lot of breaking changes on java and clojure version.

- Java: Update jna version from 4.0.0 to 4.1.0.
- Java: Remove ISocket interface (due to wrong design).
- Java: Remodeled IAsyncScheduler interface (for allow other implementations).
- Java: Add EPoll and EPollScheduler implementation for async sockets in linux.
- Java: Remodeled the Socket methods: now the default interface to send and recv is using ByteBuffer.
- Java: Removed IMessage and Message abstractions (useless).
- Clojure: Adapt internals to java api changes.
- Clojure: Start working through abstractions (everything defined as protocol)
- Clojure: Use reify instead usless defrecords.
- Clojure: Low level async support is now modeled using callbacks instead core.async.
